        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born into a family of eight siblings in Mexico City.  My parents taught me from a very
        young age the importance of an education.  Although my parents lacked the opportunities to attain
        a higher education, they were respected in the neighborhood due to their hard work and devotion.
        Despite their diligence, they would not meet the family's need in Mexico, so we moved to California. </p>

        <p>My first job in the United States was a migrant worker in the fields of California.  I help my parents
        pick grapes, almonds, and variuos kinds of vegetables.  I never imagined that I would one day work in the
        in the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Proud to have had that early experience in agriculture, I
        value the infortance or monitoring issues with Consultative Committees on Agriculture (CCA), including
        Peru, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina.  In 2004, I received a USDA Honor Award for this work. </p>

        <p>Before coming to the USDA, I received a B.A. in Political Science at California State University, and
        an M.A. in International Commerce and Policy at George Mason University, I also earned an MBA in Public
        Administration through the USDA Public Service Scholarship Program at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

        <p>Clearly, my life experience have been stepping-stones.  My journey every day for me represents a set of
        challenges.  Today, I am deternined to have another challenge and decided to apply for the George Washington
        University Boot Camp.</p>
